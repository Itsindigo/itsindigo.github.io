        <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>

        <p>
          Stated simply - this website exists because I am doing the hard thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          And for me, the hard thing just so happens to be writing. Not
          literally, I know how words go together to form a sentence, and I can
          hold a pen for about half a page before my hand starts to cramp.
        </p>

        <p>
          No. I'm talking about the kind of writing you put out in public.
          Writing that is deliberate in its message. Writing that requires you
          to expose your thinking to the world. The kind of writing that makes
          you vulnerable.
        </p>

        <p>
          For context, besides the occasional
          <a
            href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/"
            >technical design document</a
          >
          that my work requires, I haven't produced any substantive text
          artifact since I left high school almost 15 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live a chronically online life that means I'm probably at some kind
          of keyboard at least 10 hours a day - every day. But the characters
          I'm producing aren't the valuable kind. They're the instant messaging,
          fire-and-forget typeâ€”don't worry about the mistakes because they're
          gone in an instant.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I'm not good at writing, and don't misunderstand me, I'm not
          beating myself up over this. I don't play the piano. And so if I were
          to sit down at a piano, I wouldn't sit there scratching my head and
          wondering why I can't tap out a tune. I wouldn't be able to play
          because I haven't put in the hard hours of work to develop the skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think writing is much the same. The muscles haven't atrophied, they
          were never there to begin with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of this desire to become a better writer is undoubtedly tied up
          in self-worth, and a desire to produce things that I am proud of. A
          lot of the <a href="/pages/books/index.html">books</a> I've read these
          past 18 months talk about responsibility, accountability, intentional
          decision making as key factors in developing healthy self-esteem.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I can capture my thoughts and intentions in writing, then I can
          better express them in conversation, or perhaps in other creative
          mediums in future.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've identified three specific vectors that I can start working on:
          clarity of message, crafting compelling stories, and improving the
          grammatical and structural elements of my writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, clarity of message. One of my great strengths is that I tend
          to think laterally. Where one person might hear a fact as given, my
          mind has a natural tendency to branch across many other abstractly
          related topics, allowing me to find links where others see none. This
          might sometimes be called "outside the box" thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this works great for me, to the outsider looking in, it can be
          unclear how I started at point A and arrived at point Z. Writing is a
          vehicle through which I can describe this process and transform what
          might look like a chaotic stream into a meaningful message.
        </p>

        <p>
          Secondly, I'm interested in the power of stories. Professor Scott
          Galloway has
          <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/storytelling/"
            >this great piece on storytelling</a
          >. He makes the case for storytelling being the most valuable skill a
          person can learn. Now, I don't know about that, but there's
          undoubtedly some truth in what he's saying. Your ideas only have value
          if you can convince other people that they have value too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building the underlying systems to recall specific quotes and factoids
          will be essential to improving this skill. Two of my favourite authors
          <a href="https://powerseductionandwar.com/">Robert Greene</a> and
          <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/">Ryan Holiday</a> are excellent at
          this, and I will certainly be leaning on their writings for future
          inspiration.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, the grammar and structure of my writing. What I really
          mean here is the objective quality of my words. The use of correct
          vocabulary, escaping my overuse of the comma in favour of full
          sentences. And laying out my thoughts such that each claim is
          supported and forms a cohesive narrative.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even in this short post I'm learning just how hard this is going to
          be. These past ten minutes as I try to round out a summary, the desire
          to hit CMD A and backspace swells up inside me.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why does this site exist? I started writing this post thinking it was
          about developing a skill. But as I've sat here I've realised that's
          not true at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          This site exists to combat fear. Fear of failure, fear of not being
          good enough, fear of being judged, fear of intellectual inadequacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now please excuse me, I'm going to press publish and supress the
          desire to vomit.
